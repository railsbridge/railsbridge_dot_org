%h1 There are no RailsBridge employees.
%p
  RailsBridge is an
  %em extremely
  non-heirarchical organization, full of people who want to make tech better and are willing to donate their time and resources to that effort. From 2009 to 2013, RailsBridge's three-person board comprised Sarah Mei and Sarah Allen, co-founders, and Austin Putman, treasurer. Now, RailsBridge (and its umbrella organization, Bridge Foundry), is project of #{ link_to "School Factory", "http://schoolfactory.org/" }, which gives us 501(c)3 status, but with all the autonomy we need.
