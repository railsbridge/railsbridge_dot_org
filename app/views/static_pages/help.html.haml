%h1 Helping people learn to program is an amazing experience.
= image_tag "workshop-shots/programming.jpg", width: "450", class: "float-right", alt: "People discussing programming in a fun conference room."

%p The most visible volunteer positions within RailsBridge are the workshop sponsors, organizers, teachers, and TAs. They make each workshop happen!

%h3 Want to teach?
%p Yay! Head over to the #{link_to "upcoming workshops page", :events} to see if one is coming up near you. If not, get in touch with your #{link_to "local chapter", :chapters} (or start one if it doesn't exist).

%h3 Want to organize?
%p Fantastic. Read through the #{link_to "organizing page", :organize} and #{link_to "fill out our short interest form", :interest_form}!

%h3 Want to host or sponsor?
%p That's awesome. Check out our #{ link_to "information for hosts", :host } and #{ link_to "Donor FAQ", :donor_faq }.
